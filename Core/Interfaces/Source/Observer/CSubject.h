// THREAD SAFETY NOTE
//
// Affects CSubject class implementation
//
// Currently there are no concurrent initial attach or detach operations on subject
// objects. Thus corresponding locking operations (protecting the integrity of
// the observers list) are disabled.
//
// It is not recommended to introduce concurrency of this sort, because it not only
// would result in additional performance impact to _all_ operations with subject
// (including frequent PostChanges), but also would introduce the risk of deadlocks
// (implementation of the Change Control Manager will have to be carefully revised).
// Most probably eliminating the deadlocks threat will further increase the overhead.
// One of the ways to avoid deadlock is posting change notifications (ChangeOccured)
// after the lock is released, but this would require ref counting on the IObserver
// interface.
//
// Yet concurrent _repeated_ attaches (updating interest bits for already registered
// CCM observer) are possible, so the protection against race conditions introduced
// by them must always be in place.
